    <h2>Now the fun Part</h2>
    <p>
      At first you have to finely dice the carrots, onion and celery into little
      cubes. Fry slowly in about four tablespoons of olive oil until soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now add the mnced meat and chop it with a cooking spoon so it doesen't
      stick together into big balls. Fry and stirr it until fully cooked - you
      can fry it a bit further to get some roasted flavour.
    </p>
    <p>When done add the tomato paste and let it get hot for a few seconds.</p>
    <p>Add the red wine and let it simmer until almost fully reduced.</p>
    <p>
      Its time for both of the tomato cans. Add all the herbs and spices (I
      recommend Italian) and a little bit of sugar - of course also salt and
      pepper - let it simmer for about 20 minutes. Don't forget to stirr from
      time to time. If it becomes ab bit to dry and thick, just add some red
      wine or water to keep it liquid. Also don't keep it to fluid because you
      want a stable Lasagna afterwards
    </p>
    <p>While it simmers, you can parallel make the bechamel sauce</p>
